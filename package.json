This ecommerce website codebase uses React, CSS, and HTML to create a responsive and modern UI. It includes a header, footer, product list, and product cards. The product list is hardcoded for demonstration purposes, but you can easily replace it with a dynamic API call or database connection.

To run the website, simply open the `index.html` file in your browser or use the CodeSandbox live preview feature.
